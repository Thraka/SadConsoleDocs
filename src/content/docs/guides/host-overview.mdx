description: Discover what a SadConsole game host does and how your game targets a specific host for rendering and input processing.

A SadConsole host is the graphics engine that draws to the screen, processes input, and handles the game logic-loop. SadConsole doesn't draw or handle input natively. It's a generic library that relies on a "host" to provide the rendering engine and input processing.

SadConsole supports three game hosts: [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/), [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/), and FNA.

## MonoGame

The MonoGame host is [NuGet package `SadConsole.Host.MonoGame`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SadConsole.Host.MonoGame/).

MonoGame is a community-driven game engine that supports 2D and 3D. The main SadConsole library only describes objects rendered in 2D; however, you can still use MonoGame's 3D capabilities. MonoGame has the following features:

- 3D and 2D rendering capabilities.
- Cross-platform support for other operating systems.
- Built for .NET.
- Large community of users.

## SFML

The SFML host is [NuGet package `SadConsole.Host.SFML`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SadConsole.Host.SFML/).

SFML is a C engine built for 2D games. SFML has bindings for multiple languages, including .NET languages. SFML does work cross-platform, but requires significant effort to configure for other operating systems. SadConsole with SFML is currently built for Windows.

## The host interface

SadConsole is designed to be unaware of the host rendering engine. The [SadConsole.GameHost](/reference/sadconsole.gamehost/) base class defines common functionality for all host renderers. A host might provide specific capabilities and types, but you generally don't need them unless you want to do something specific with the host renderer, like using MonoGame's 3D capabilities.

After starting a game, access the host through the [GameHost.Instance](/reference/sadconsole.gamehost/#instance) property.

## Input processing

SadConsole performs many operations during the **update** frame, including input processing. The input processor handles keyboard and mouse state. Mouse-related input events are continually processed on the object under the mouse cursor, but keyboard input works differently. Only the currently _focused_ object receives keyboard input. The [GameHost.FocusedScreenObjects](/reference/sadconsole.gamehost/#focusedscreenobjects) property designates the focused object.

You can easily have an object set itself as focused by setting [IsFocused](/reference/sadconsole.iscreenobject/#isfocused) to `true`.

### Mouse

Mouse input scans the [GameHost.Screen](/reference/sadconsole.gamehost/#screen) object hierarchy and determines which object is under the mouse. That object's [ProcessMouse(MouseScreenObjectState)](/reference/sadconsole.iscreenobject/#processmousemousescreenobjectstate) method is called. This method checks the [UseMouse](/reference/sadconsole.iscreenobject/#usemouse) property, and if it's `true`, the object handles the mouse. When the object processes the mouse, it raises the following input events:

- [MouseEnter](/reference/sadconsole.iscreensurface/#mouseenter)
- [MouseMove](/reference/sadconsole.iscreensurface/#mousemove)
- [MouseButtonClicked](/reference/sadconsole.iscreensurface/#mousebuttonclicked)
- [MouseExit](/reference/sadconsole.iscreensurface/#mouseexit)

### Keyboard

Keyboard input is always sent to the "focused" object. An object is considered focused when its [IsFocused](/reference/sadconsole.iscreenobject/#isfocused) property is set to `true` and it's the top-most object in the [GameHost.FocusedScreenObjects](/reference/sadconsole.gamehost/#focusedscreenobjects) collection. When focused, SadConsole calls the object's [ProcessKeyboard(Keyboard)](/reference/sadconsole.iscreenobject/#processkeyboardkeyboard) method every **update** frame. If the object's [UseKeyboard](/reference/sadconsole.iscreenobject/#usekeyboard) property is `true`, the keyboard input is processed.
