A "font" in SadConsole displays characters on the screen. The font can be a mix of textual glyphs or graphical tiles. Fonts consist of two parts: the image file and the config file. The image can be in any format that the current [host](/guides/host-overview/) supports, most likely MonoGame. Both the MonoGame and SFML hosts support loading _.png_ images, making that format a safe choice.

## Image file

The image file of the font must use a transparent background, _not_ a colored key file. The glyphs in the font graphic should use a pure white color `(255, 255, 255)` for the foreground. The image file should have two very specific glyphs: a fully transparent glyph, and a fully filled-in glyph.

Here is an example of the standard font graphic included in SadConsole.

<Aside type="note">
Normally, the background of the font texture is transparent, not black. In this article, it's black so that you can see the glyphs.

## Glyph indices

The font breaks down into glyph cells referenced by index. Index **0** represents the top-left cell and counts up moving right, where the next cell is **1**. Once the index reaches the end of the row, it moves to the next row and continues counting.

When text is written to a surface or console, all characters land on the surface at the appropriate positions. Surfaces and consoles draw font glyphs by index. All English characters in the font file sit at their matching keyboard keycode index. Character `A` (code 65) sits at index 65, while character `z` (code 122) sits at index 122. If you place index 66 at **(0,0)** on a surface, you'll see the `B` character at **(0,0)**.

## Font config file

Each graphical font has a special config file that tells SadConsole how to interpret the image file. This is a JSON-encoded file that ends with the _.font_ extension.

Here's an example of a font config file. According to this config, each glyph in the image file is 8 pixels wide by 16 pixels tall. A 1-pixel spacing separates every glyph, and the solid-filled glyph index is 219.

```json
{
  "$type": "SadConsole.SadFont, SadConsole",
  "Name": "IBM_8x16",
  "FilePath": "IBM8x16.png",
  "GlyphHeight": 16,
  "GlyphPadding": 1,
  "GlyphWidth": 8,
  "SolidGlyphIndex": 219,
  "Columns": 16,
  "IsSadExtended": false
}
```

## Font requirements

Keep these requirements in mind for the font image and config files:

- Index 0 in the image file should be completely transparent.

  SadConsole considers index 0 a dead glyph and uses it for optimization. SadConsole draws any glyph besides 0 to the screen, even if it's completely transparent, but always skips glyph 0.

- The config file must set the `SolidGlyphIndex` property. In a Code Page 437 font, which is what SadConsole is built around, this is index 219.

  The solid white glyph fills the backgrounds of cells.

## Font sizes

Fonts used by surfaces require a "size" to determine how big each glyph appears. In general, the font has a built-in size that corresponds to the dimensions of the individual glyphs in the image file. The size used with a surface can be any pixel amount, and the renderer stretches the font to that size.

When you need to generate a font size, use the [IFont.GetFontSize(Sizes)](/reference/sadconsole.ifont#getfontsizesizes) method, passing in a size value. Size values generate pixel-aligned font sizes. Use the font object you want to generate a font size from. After you create a surface, you can change the font. To ensure you use the appropriate font size, use the surface's current font to generate a size. For example, the following code creates the surface object first, which uses the default font, then uses the assigned font to generate a font size two times bigger.

```csharp
SadConsole.ScreenSurface surfaceObj = new(80, 24);

surfaceObj.FontSize = surfaceObj.Font.GetFontSize(IFont.Sizes.Two);
```

## Default font

SadConsole uses the IBM 8x16 Code Page 437 font by default. The default font, set by the [GameHost.DefaultFont](/reference/sadconsole.gamehost#defaultfont) property, applies automatically to every SadConsole surface object unless you designate a different font when creating the object.

To use a custom font on startup, adjust the game config that starts SadConsole. For more information, see [Use your own font as the default font](/guides/config/#use-your-own-font-as-the-default-font).

```csharp
using SadConsole.Configuration;

Game.Configuration gameStartup = new Game.Configuration()
    // ...config options...
    .ConfigureFonts(SetupFont)
    ;

Game.Create(gameStartup);
Game.Instance.Run();
Game.Instance.Dispose();

static void SetupFont(Game.ConfigurationFontLoader loader)
{
    loader.UseCustomFont("fonts\\new.font");
}
```

### Changing the default font after SadConsole has started

To change the default font after SadConsole starts, set the `SadConsole.Game.Instance.DefaultFont` property to a different font instance. Any object created **after** the default font changes uses the new default font.

## Load a font

The game host loads fonts with the [GameHost.LoadFont(string)](/reference/sadconsole.gamehost#loadfontstring) method. When you load a font, SadConsole registers it with the [GameHost.Fonts](/reference/sadconsole.gamehost#fonts) dictionary, which uses the font name as the key, and then returns the instance.

Fonts can be preloaded with the game config before your game starts. For more information, see [Use a delegate to configure the font options](/guides/config/#use-a-delegate-to-configure-the-font-options).
