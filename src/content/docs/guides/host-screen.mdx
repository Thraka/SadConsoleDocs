The [`SadConsole.GameHost.Screen`](/reference/sadconsole.gamehost#screen) property is one of the most important properties in SadConsole. It determines what's displayed and what receives keyboard and mouse input.

<Aside type="tip">
Access the host through the `SadConsole.GameHost.Instance` property.

## What does the Screen represent?

`GameHost.Screen` represents the consoles and surfaces displayed to the user. It's the single root object; all other objects are children of it. Objects can have unlimited children at any depth.

Swap `GameHost.Screen` to transition between parts of your game. For example, when your game starts, show a title screen with all its logic. Based on the user's selection, swap `GameHost.Screen` to an instance that represents the settings menu or the game itself.

## Designate the startup screen

The game configuration object sets the startup screen. {/* TODO: Link to game startup/config guide once migrated */}

Create a class that inherits from `IScreenObject` and configure it with your consoles, surfaces, and input handling code. Then, call the [`SetStartingScreen<TRootObject>(Builder)`](/reference/sadconsole.configuration.extensions#setstartingscreentrootobjectbuilder) configuration method with your type. Your startup code assigns [`SadConsole.GameHost.Screen`](/reference/sadconsole.gamehost#screen) automatically through this configuration.

**Configuration setting**

```csharp
using SadConsole.Configuration;

Game.Configuration gameStartup = new Game.Configuration()
    .SetScreenSize(120, 38)
    .SetStartingScreen<RootScreen>() // Startup object type is here
    ;

Game.Create(gameStartup);
Game.Instance.Run();
Game.Instance.Dispose();
```

**Starting screen type**

```csharp
class RootScreen : ScreenObject
{
    public RootScreen()
    {
        // Code here to create consoles, objects, and arrange them.
        // Each object should be added to the Children collection.
    }
}
```
