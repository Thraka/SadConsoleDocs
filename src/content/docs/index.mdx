    With SadConsole you can make ascii-styled games for modern platforms. At its heart, SadConsole is really a giant tile-based game engine. However, its object model is conceptually similar to a traditional **console** app.

    SadConsole is offered as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SadConsole/) and supports MonoGame, SFML, and FNA as rendering engines.

    To get started with SadConsole, see [Create a new SadConsole .NET project with the SadConsole templates](getting-started/cli).
