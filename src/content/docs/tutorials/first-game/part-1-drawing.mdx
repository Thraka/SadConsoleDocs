Welcome to the start of the Getting Started with SadConsole tutorial series. This series guides you on how to use the basic parts of SadConsole from the perspective of a new coder.

## Prerequisites

To start this tutorial you'll have to create a SadConsole project. Follow the [Create a SadConsole project with the templates](/getting-started/cli/) guide, which works for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

<Aside type="caution">
Because of the added complexity, avoid creating a MonoGame project with the MonoGame Visual Studio templates.
</Aside>

## Sync your code to mine

Regardless of whether you used the [CLI templates](/getting-started/cli/) or [Visual Studio templates](/getting-started/visualstudio/), you'll have to change some things for this tutorial series.

<Steps>
01. Update the project file. Open your project file, it's probably named _MyGame.csproj_ or _SadConsoleGame.csproj_. Replace the content with the following snippet:

    <Aside type="tip">
    If you're using a different `<TargetFramework>` such as .NET 9, feel free to update that setting.
    </Aside>

    ```xml
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
    
      <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
        <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
        <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
        <RootNamespace>Temp</RootNamespace>
        <ApplicationManifest>app.manifest</ApplicationManifest>
      </PropertyGroup>

      <ItemGroup>
        <Using Include="SadConsole" />
        <Using Include="SadRogue.Primitives" />
        <Using Include="SadConsole.Console" Alias="Console" />
      </ItemGroup>

      <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL" Version="3.8.3" />
        <PackageReference Include="SadConsole.Host.MonoGame" Version="10.6.0" />
        <PackageReference Include="SadConsole.Extended" Version="10.6.0" />
      </ItemGroup>
    
    </Project>
    ```

    If you get a compiler error related to `<ApplicationManifest>`, you can remove that line. This is a file generated by the MonoGame template, and it helps with 4k monitors.

    Notice the `<Using>` elements. These may be new to you if you're already familiar with C#. These statements automatically import the associated namespace to every code file in your project. This means that you can omit lines like `using SadConsole;` in all of your code files. This also maps the `Console` type to `SadConsole.Console` so that `System.Console` is not confused with `SadConsole.Console`.

01. Delete the _RootScreen.cs_ file generated by the template.
01. Open _Program.cs_ and replace the code with the following:

    ```csharp
    using SadConsole.Configuration;

    Settings.WindowTitle = "My SadConsole Game";

    Builder
        .GetBuilder()
        .SetWindowSizeInCells(90, 30)
        .ConfigureFonts(true)
        .UseDefaultConsole()
        .OnStart(Startup)
        .Run();

    static void Startup(object? sender, GameHost host)
    {
        Game.Instance.StartingConsole!.FillWithRandomGarbage(SadConsole.Game.Instance.StartingConsole!.Font);
        Game.Instance.StartingConsole.Fill(new Rectangle(3, 3, 23, 3), Color.Violet, Color.Black, 0, Mirror.None);
        Game.Instance.StartingConsole.Print(4, 4, "Hello from SadConsole");
    }
    ```
</Steps>
You should be able to run this code and see the following output. You can run your program by pressing the <kbd>F5</kbd> key. If you're using the terminal, run `dotnet run`:

## Explore the sample code

SadConsole uses the `static void Startup(object? sender, GameHost host)` method as an event handler. When the game starts, SadConsole calls this method and runs any code you provide. Use this hook to add extra initialization code for your game, such as creating startup variables and objects. For now, this method gives you a simple place to explore and play with SadConsole without creating real game code.

Let's explore the `Startup` method:

```csharp
static void Startup(object? sender, GameHost host)
{
    Game.Instance.StartingConsole!.FillWithRandomGarbage(SadConsole.Game.Instance.StartingConsole!.Font);
    Game.Instance.StartingConsole.Fill(new Rectangle(3, 3, 23, 3), Color.Violet, Color.Black, 0, Mirror.None);
    Game.Instance.StartingConsole.Print(4, 4, "Hello from SadConsole");
}
```

- This code accesses the default starting console. You provided the size of the starting console when you created the SadConsole game. The first line fills the console with some garbage, that is, random characters and colors:

  ```csharp
  Game.Instance.StartingConsole!.FillWithRandomGarbage(SadConsole.Game.Instance.StartingConsole!.Font);
  ```

  Did you notice the `!` in that line of code? Because `StartingConsole` can be null, you need to tell C# that you're aware of this condition and certain it isn't null, which is what the `!` (null-forgiving) operator does in this case. This isn't required, but if your code editor warns you that `StartingConsole` might be null, the operator disables that warning. You know it's not null because the startup code called `.UseDefaultConsole()` which creates a default console for you to use.

- The next line fills a rectangle region with some color to create a box.

  ```csharp
  Game.Instance.StartingConsole.Fill(new Rectangle(3, 3, 23, 3), Color.Violet, Color.Black, 0, Mirror.None);
  ```

  The parameters are as follows:

  - Region to fill defined by X, Y, Width, Height: `new Rectangle(3, 3, 23, 3)`
  - The foreground color to use for each region character: `Color.Violet`
  - The background color to use for each region character: `Color.Black`
  - The glyph character to fill, `0` represents an empty character.
  - The mirror setting for the glyph.
  
    You can mirror them horizontally or vertically. Because the `FillWithRandomGarbage` randomizes the mirror, this needs to be cleared for the area.

- The last line prints some text at position 4, 4. This position is inside the box. Because the `Print` statement doesn't specify any color settings, the text has the same foreground and background as cells in the surface it replaces. The colors were set by the `Fill` method, which had a foreground of **Violet** and a background of **Black**.

  ```csharp
  Game.Instance.StartingConsole.Print(4, 4, "Hello from SadConsole");
  ```

Play around with these methods. Try filling in some other boxes, changing the colors, and printing different strings to different areas. You can remove the `FillWithRandomGarbage` line if you would like a cleaner area while playing around.

## Draw more

Add more code to the `Startup` method to draw more on the screen. First, simplify access to `Game.Instance.StartingConsole` by assigning it to a variable named `startingConsole`. Copy and paste this code over your existing code to stay in sync with the article:

```csharp
static void Startup(object? sender, GameHost host)
{
    Console startingConsole = Game.Instance.StartingConsole!;

    startingConsole.FillWithRandomGarbage(startingConsole.Font);
    startingConsole.Fill(new Rectangle(3, 3, 23, 3), Color.Violet, Color.Black, 0, Mirror.None);
    startingConsole.Print(4, 4, "Hello from SadConsole");
}
```

### Shapes

Previously, you used `Fill` to fill a rectangular region. With SadConsole, you can draw shapes such as a rectangle or an ellipse. This works like `Fill` but gives you more control over the drawing. For example, you can apply a border to the box you draw—something `Fill` can't do.

#### Box

After the `Print` line that prints _"Hello from SadConsole"_, add the following to draw a box around it:

```csharp
startingConsole.DrawBox(new Rectangle(3, 3, 23, 3), ShapeParameters.CreateBorder(new ColoredGlyph(Color.Violet, Color.Black, 176)));
```

![box shape in SadConsole](/article-assets/images/tutorials/first-game/part-1-drawing/part1-shapes-1.png)

The `DrawBox` method takes a region and a `ShapeParameters` object. The `ShapeParameters` object defines the style in which to create a shape, and in this case, the box. The code uses it in a simple mode, just providing a `ColoredGlyph` for the border. A `ColoredGlyph` type represents a foreground color, a background color, and a glyph character—all in a single type. This glyph is what gets drawn as the border of the box. A `ColoredGlyph` also specifies the fill of the shape, but skip that for now.

The `DrawBox` method breaks down into the following parameters:

- **Rectangle**: This is the region to draw box in.
- **Shape Parameters**: The style of border and fill settings that are applied to the box.

With `DrawBox` you can also specify that you want to use a line style for the box instead of the glyph character provided.

```csharp
startingConsole.DrawBox(new Rectangle(3, 3, 23, 3), ShapeParameters.CreateStyledBox(ICellSurface.ConnectedLineThin,
                                                    new ColoredGlyph(Color.Violet, Color.Black)));
```

![line shape in SadConsole](/article-assets/images/tutorials/first-game/part-1-drawing/part1-shapes-2.png)

`ShapeParameters` describes many ways to create the box. While the `ShapeParameters.CreateBorder` method used a `ColoredGlyph` to set the foreground, background, and symbol used to draw the whole border, `ShapeParameters.CreateStyledBox` instead uses a _connected line style_ for the symbols used to draw the box. A `ColoredGlyph` is still used to set the foreground and background of the border. A few line styles exist, and you can create your own. Here are two of the most common:

- `ICellSurface.ConnectedLineThin`: A thin single line.
- `ICellSurface.ConnectedLineThick`: A thick double line.

Try the **Thick** line style to see how it looks.

#### Circle

Next, let's draw a circle, it follows roughly the same pattern:

```csharp
startingConsole.DrawCircle(new Rectangle(5, 8, 16, 8), ShapeParameters.CreateFilled(new ColoredGlyph(Color.Violet, Color.Black, 176),
                                                       new ColoredGlyph(Color.White, Color.Black)));
```

The code above is using a black background to fill the box.

Run your game and you'll see the following screen:

![circle shape in SadConsole](/article-assets/images/tutorials/first-game/part-1-drawing/part1-shapes-3.png)

#### Line

The line shape is the simplest. You don't worry about fill—simply set the starting point of the line, the ending point, and then what glyph and colors to use when drawing the line.

Before drawing a line, remove the `FillWithRandomGarbage` code line. All this visual noise makes it hard to see something as small as a line. After removing that code line, add the following line to the end of your code:

```csharp
startingConsole.DrawLine(new Point(60, 5), new Point(66, 20), '$', Color.AnsiBlue, Color.AnsiBlueBright, Mirror.None);
```

Your `Startup` method should look like the following:

```csharp
static void Startup(object? sender, GameHost host)
{
    Console startingConsole = Game.Instance.StartingConsole!;

    startingConsole.Fill(new Rectangle(3, 3, 23, 3), Color.Violet, Color.Black, 0, Mirror.None);
    startingConsole.Print(4, 4, "Hello from SadConsole");

    startingConsole.DrawBox(new Rectangle(3, 3, 23, 3), ShapeParameters.CreateStyledBox(ICellSurface.ConnectedLineThin,
                                                        new ColoredGlyph(Color.Violet, Color.Black)));

    startingConsole.DrawCircle(new Rectangle(5, 8, 16, 8), ShapeParameters.CreateFilled(new ColoredGlyph(Color.Violet, Color.Black, 176),
                                                           new ColoredGlyph(Color.White, Color.Black)));

    startingConsole.DrawLine(new Point(60, 5), new Point(66, 20), '$', Color.AnsiBlue, Color.AnsiBlueBright, Mirror.None);
}
```

Run your game and you'll see the following screen:

## Other basics

A few other methods let you change a console. The `Print` method works at a specific position and prints a string with a foreground and background color, but you can also work with individual cells. You can adjust the foreground color, the background color, the glyph, or the glyph mirror of any cell in the console, by referring to its X,Y coordinate.

- **Set the foreground color of a cell.** A glyph displays in the foreground color of the cell. By changing the foreground color, you change the color of the glyph. If the glyph is set to `0`, it's blank and you won't see any character symbol or the foreground color for that cell. In this example, this alters the _S_ in _SadConsole_.

  ```csharp
  // X, Y, Color
  startingConsole.SetForeground(15, 4, Color.DarkGreen);
  ```

- **Set the background of a cell.** This fills the cell with a specific color, while the glyph draws on top of the color. In this example, this alters the _C_ in _SadConsole_.

  ```csharp
  // X, Y, Color
  startingConsole.SetBackground(18, 4, Color.DarkCyan);
  ```

- **Set the glyph of a cell.** This changes the character displayed in the cell. The glyph is based on the character index in the font file. In this example, this alters the _H_ in _Hello_.

  ```csharp
  // X, Y, Glyph index or character
  startingConsole.SetGlyph(4, 4, '@'); // use '@' or 1, they're the same index glyph
  ```

- **Change the mirror of a cell.** Each cell is initially set to `None` which represents un-mirrored. You can set the mirror to `None`, `Horizontal`, or `Vertical`. In this example, this alters the _f_ in _from_.

  ```csharp
  // X, Y, Mirror set
  startingConsole.SetMirror(10, 4, Mirror.Vertical);
  ```

## Conclusion

You've now explored some of the basics of SadConsole. Use `Game.Instance.StartingConsole` to quickly prototype and experiment. Keep experimenting with these methods. The next part of this series explores the Console cursor and the screen layout system built into SadConsole.
