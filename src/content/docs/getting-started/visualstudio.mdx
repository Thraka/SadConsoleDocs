Learn how to create a new project based on SadConsole using .NET 8.0 (or later) and Visual Studio.

Before you start, install the SadConsole project templates. The [Create a SadConsole project with the templates](/getting-started/cli/) article walks you through the installation. Follow those instructions and then come back here.

<Aside type="tip">
It's much faster to [create a project with the templates](/getting-started/cli/) and then open it in Visual Studio.
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
01. [Download and install Visual Studio 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
01. During installation, select the **.NET Desktop development** workload.

    <Aside type="tip">
    If you've already installed Visual Studio, modify your installation with the **Visual Studio Installer** app.
    </Aside>

01. Install the SadConsole templates with the dotnet command: `dotnet new install SadConsole.Templates`. For more information on how to install the templates, see [Create a SadConsole project with the templates](/getting-started/cli/).
</Steps>

## Create a new project

Start Visual Studio.

<Steps>
01. In the **Create a new project** dialog, type `sadconsole` into the search box and select the **SadConsole Game (MonoGame)** project template.

    ![create a new SadConsole project in visual studio](images/visualstudio/template.png)

    The **SadConsole Game (MonoGame)** template creates a SadConsole game that uses [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/), and the **SadConsole Game (SFML)** template creates a game that uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

    MonoGame and SFML are the backend renderers for SadConsole. In general, your SadConsole code works the same regardless of which renderer you choose. However, as your game grows in complexity, the choice of renderer becomes important. Use the MonoGame renderer because it has the following benefits:

    - It offers easier cross-platform targeting.
    - It supports 3D rendering, such as models and scenes.
    - It's built for .NET development.

    SFML is cross-platform but requires more work to set up.

01. Press **Next** and then set the **Project name** to `SadConsoleGame` and choose a **Location** on your computer to save the project.
</Steps>

Congratulations, you have a new project! Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to run the game:

## Create a project without a template

You can also create a project without using the SadConsole templates. It's straightforward.

<Steps>
01. Create a new **Console App** with either C# or VB.NET.

    <Aside type="caution">
    Don't create a **Console App (.NET Framework)** project!
    </Aside>

01. Press **Next** and follow the wizard to set the name of the project to `SadConsoleGame`.
01. Set the **Location** of your project code, and then press **Next**.
01. Set the **Framework** to **.NET 8.0** or later.

    <Aside type="caution">
    Make sure that **Do not use top-level statements** is **unchecked**, unless you know what you're doing and can convert the code in the next section.
    </Aside>

01. Press **Create**.
01. Next, add the **NuGet SadConsole MonoGame** renderer package to the project.

    01. In the **Solution Explorer**, right-click on the project and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. This displays the NuGet package manager.
    01. Search for **SadConsole** and install the `SadConsole.Host.MonoGame` package.
    01. Search for **MonoGame.Framework** and install the `MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL` package.

</Steps>

Congratulations, you have all the required libraries to start creating a SadConsole game!

## Configure the startup code

Make a small change to the project file, and then update the auto-generated startup code.

### Project file

Open the project file, which is probably named _SadConsoleGame.csproj_. Replace the content with the following snippet:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <RootNamespace>SadConsoleGame</RootNamespace>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <Using Include="SadConsole" />
    <Using Include="SadRogue.Primitives" />
    <Using Include="SadConsole.Console" Alias="Console" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL" Version="3.8.3" />
    <PackageReference Include="SadConsole.Host.MonoGame" Version="10.6.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="SadConsole.Extended" Version="10.6.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

### Root screen

The startup code will designate a startup object, known as the "root screen." That object is a `ScreenObject` type, or any type derived from `ScreenObject` such as `ScreenSurface`. Create a new root screen:

<Steps>
01. In the **Solution Explorer** window, right-click on the project and select **Add** > **Class**.
01. Name the class `RootScreen` and create it. The code editor opens.
01. Replace the generated code with the following:

    ```csharp
    class RootScreen : ScreenObject
    {
        private ScreenSurface _mainSurface;
    
        public RootScreen()
        {
            // Create a surface that's the same size as the screen.
            _mainSurface = new ScreenSurface(Game.Instance.ScreenCellsX, Game.Instance.ScreenCellsY);
    
            // Fill the surface with random characters and colors
            _mainSurface.FillWithRandomGarbage(_mainSurface.Font);
    
            // Create a rectangle box that has a violet foreground and black background.
            // Characters are reset to 0 and mirroring is set to none.
            _mainSurface.Fill(new Rectangle(3, 3, 23, 3), Color.Violet, Color.Black, 0, Mirror.None);
    
            // Print some text at (4, 4) using the foreground and background already there (violet and black)
            _mainSurface.Print(4, 4, "Hello from SadConsole");
    
            // Add _mainSurface as a child object of this one. This object, RootScreen, is a simple object
            // and doesn't display anything itself. Since _mainSurface is going to be a child of it, _mainSurface
            // will be displayed when RootScreen is either the starting screen or somewhere in that collection of objects.
            Children.Add(_mainSurface);
        }
    }
    ```
</Steps>

### Program startup code

<Steps>
01. In the **Solution Explorer** window, double-click _Program.cs_. This opens the code editor.
01. Replace the code with the following:

    ```csharp
    using SadConsole.Configuration;

    Settings.WindowTitle = "My SadConsole Game";

    Builder
        .GetBuilder()
        .SetWindowSizeInCells(90, 30)
        .SetStartingScreen<RootScreen>()
        .IsStartingScreenFocused(true)
        .ConfigureFonts(true)
        .Run();
    ```

01. Press the <kbd>F5</kbd> key to run your SadConsole program. You should be presented with the following screen:

    ![a new console in SadConsole with hello text](images/visualstudio/hello-window.png)
</Steps>
