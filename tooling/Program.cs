// This tooling set has been split into per-command single-file tools.
// Run each tool with .NET 10 file-based programs, for example:
//   dotnet run toc2sidebar.cs
//   dotnet run md2mdx.cs
//   dotnet run uid2slug.cs
//   dotnet run copyassets.cs
// Files live in the same folder as this Program.cs file.
